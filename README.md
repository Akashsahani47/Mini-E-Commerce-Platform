# Mini E-Commerce Platform

## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to the **Mini E-Commerce Platform**! This is a simple web application that allows users to submit products and view them in a sleek, user-friendly interface. Additionally, the platform supports basic search functionality, enabling users to find products by name or description.

Built using modern technologies like **React.js**, **Node.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Tailwind CSS**, this platform serves as a great foundation for anyone looking to build a full-stack e-commerce website.

## üìã Features

### **Product Submission**
- Users can submit their products by entering:
  - **Product Name**
  - **Price**
  - **Description**
  - **Image URL** (optional)

### **My Products**
- Users can view all the products they have submitted in a card-based layout.
- Each product displays:
  - **Product Name**
  - **Price**
  - **Description**
  - **Image** (if provided)

### **Smart Search** (Optional)
- A search bar allows users to search for products by **name** or **keywords**. 
  - For example: typing `chair` should return any product with the word "chair" in its name or description.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (with npm)
- **PostgreSQL** (or any relational database of your choice)
- **Git** (for version control)

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   Install frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
Your frontend application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
Install backend dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Set up your PostgreSQL database:

Create a new database and user.

Update the database credentials in the database.js file (or equivalent).

Start the backend server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000.

Database Configuration
Ensure your PostgreSQL database contains a products table with the following columns:

id: Primary Key (integer, auto-increment)

name: Product name (text)

price: Product price (decimal)

description: Product description (text)

image_url: Optional image URL (text)

Search Feature (Optional)
The Search feature allows users to find products by name or description. The search logic can be implemented on the backend, using text matching or enhanced with AI/semantic search for better results.

üìà Future Enhancements
Here are a few features we plan to add in the future:

User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login functionalities using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

AI-based Search: Implement semantic search using OpenAI embeddings for more accurate results.

Shopping Cart & Checkout: Add the ability for users to add items to their cart and proceed with checkout.

Product Categories & Filters: Implement filtering options like price range, categories, and more.

Admin Panel: An admin interface to manage products, users, and more.
